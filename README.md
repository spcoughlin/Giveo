## Architecture

Giveo is designed with a clear separation between the frontend and backend:

- **Backend**: A robust Python service built using FastAPI handles all core functionalities such as user management, charity data handling, and matching logic. It exposes RESTful APIs that the frontend consumes.
  
- **Frontend**: Developed in Swift, the iOS app provides a sleek and responsive swipe-based interface for users to browse charities and manage their donation preferences.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the FastAPI Server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The backend should now be running at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
